# Installs a rake task for for running unit tests.
#
# This file installs the 'rake unit_test' and extends 'rake test' to run unit 
# tests, if any. It is automatically generated by Noe from your .noespec file, 
# and should therefore be configured there, under the variables/rake_tasks/unit_test 
# entry, as illustrated below:
#
# variables:
#   rake_tasks:
#     unit_test:
#       pattern: test/test*.rb
#       verbose: false
#       warning: false
#       ...
#
# If you have specific needs requiring manual intervention on this file, 
# don't forget to set safe-override to false in your noe specification:
# 
# template-info:
#   manifest:
#     tasks/unit_test.rake:
#       safe-override: false
#
# More info about the TestTask and its options can be found on 
# http://rake.rubyforge.org/classes/Rake/TestTask.html
