# Installs a rake task for for running examples written using rspec.
#
# This file installs the 'rake spec_test' (aliased as 'rake spec') as well as
# extends 'rake test' to run spec tests, if any. It is automatically generated 
# by Noe from your .noespec file, and should therefore be configured there, 
# under the variables/rake_tasks/spec_test entry, as illustrated below:
#
# variables:
#   rake_tasks:
#     spec_test:
#       pattern: spec/**/*_spec.rb
#       verbose: true
#       rspec_opts: [--color, --backtrace]
#       ...
#
# If you have specific needs requiring manual intervention on this file, 
# don't forget to set safe-override to false in your noe specification:
# 
# template-info:
#   manifest:
#     tasks/spec_test.rake:
#       safe-override: false
#
# This file has been written to conform to RSpec v2.4.0. More information about 
# rspec and options of the rake task defined below can be found on 
# http://relishapp.com/rspec
