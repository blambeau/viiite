# Installs rake tasks for gemming and packaging
#
# This file installs the 'rake package', 'rake gem' tasks and associates 
# (clobber_package, repackage, ...). It is automatically generated by Noe 
# from your .noespec file, and should therefore be configured there, under 
# the variables/rake_tasks/gem entry, as illustrated below:
#
# variables:
#   rake_tasks:
#     gem:
#       package_dir: pkg
#       need_tar: false
#       need_tar_gz: false
#       need_tar_bz2: false
#       need_zip: false
#       ...
#
# If you have specific needs requiring manual intervention on this file, 
# don't forget to set safe-override to false in your noe specification:
# 
# template-info:
#   manifest:
#     tasks/gem.rake:
#       safe-override: false
#
