# Installs a rake task to generate API documentation using yard.
#
# This file installs the 'rake yard' task. It is automatically generated by Noe from 
# your .noespec file, and should therefore be configured there, under the 
# variables/rake_tasks/yard entry, as illustrated below:
#
# variables:
#   rake_tasks:
#     yard:
#       files: lib/**/*.rb
#       options: []
#       ...
#
# If you have specific needs requiring manual intervention on this file, 
# don't forget to set safe-override to false in your noe specification:
# 
# template-info:
#   manifest:
#     tasks/yard.rake:
#       safe-override: false
#
# This file has been written to conform to yard v0.6.4. More information about 
# yard and the rake task installed below can be found on http://yardoc.org/
